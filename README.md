# vCPU

A virtual CPU toolchain written in C99 — built as a bachelor's thesis at Yerevan State University.

Implements a custom 16-bit ISA from scratch, with every layer needed to go from source code to a running binary: assembler, disassembler, emulator, and a small compiled language (VCL).

```
VCL source → compiler → assembly → assembler → binary → emulator
                                                    ↑
                                              disassembler
```

A full writeup — from silicon and transistors up through the compiler — is in [`article.pdf`](article.pdf).

## Components

| | |
|---|---|
| **Assembler** | Two-pass. Converts `.asm` to `.bin`. |
| **Disassembler** | Decodes `.bin` and prints an annotated listing. |
| **Emulator** | Executes `.bin`; includes step-by-step debug mode. |
| **Compiler** | Compiles VCL source to `.asm`. |

All four tools share a single ISA definition (`include/vcpu.h`).

## Quick start

```sh
make              # build all tools
make test         # run all 323 tests
make examples     # compile and run every example, print final R0

# Full pipeline (sum 1..10 = 55)
build/bin/compiler   examples/vcl/counter.vcl   /tmp/out.asm
build/bin/assembler  /tmp/out.asm               /tmp/out.bin
build/bin/emulator   /tmp/out.bin
```

**Requirements:** GCC (or any C99 compiler), GNU Make. No external libraries.

## Article

[`article.pdf`](article.pdf) is a full walkthrough of the project — from silicon and transistors, through logic gates, arithmetic, memory, and a complete CPU, up to the assembler, emulator, and compiler. Written as an accessible read, not a formal paper.
